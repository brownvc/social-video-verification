Mat files go here. Expected naming is: mouth-data-fake<N>-ID<PERSON>.mat,
where N is the fake camera number (code expects 2,3, or 4), and PERSON 
is the participant number (code expects 1 thru 25). 

Eg: mouth-data-fake3-ID11.mat

The mat files of processed landmark data will be in the dataset download 
linked in the github repo.
